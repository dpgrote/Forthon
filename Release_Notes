   a set or get action, a subroutine that is called when the variable is
   set or get

0.7.15: October 30, 2008

0.7.12: August 29, 2008

 - Added the __version__ attribute
 - In Forthon_builder, added a fix to handle a problem with older versions of
   numpy. numpy would monkey path some of distutils routines and these would
   get imported when get_include was called. So, for older versions of numpy,
   the code from get_include is included explicitly rather than calling it
   from numpy. This only affects numpy versions older than 1.1.0.
   Note that this fix does not work for numpy 1.0.4.
 - Fixed ForthonPackage_staticarrays for multi-dimensional strings
