This contains a simple example demonstrating the use of Forthon.

List of files:

  forthon_example_source/
      __init__.py: Imports the dynamic library
      fortrhon_example.F: fortran90 source file containing python callable subroutines
      fortrhon_example.v: interface description file
  run_forthon_example.py: python script which tests the example
  Makefile: builds the example and test it
  README: this file

Building:

  To build, run "make". This runs the Forthon command that compiles and installs the example.

Running:

  Run the following command:

  python run_forthon_example.py

  This will produce output like this:

  Before setsqrt, x = 0.0
  After setsqrt, x = 3.1622776601683795

Notes:

  This example will work with both python2 and python3.
