<H3>
Python interface generator for Fortran based codes (a code development aid)
</H3>

<P>

<H3>
What is Forthon?
</H3>

<P>
Forthon generates links between Fortran95 and
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>. Python is a high
level, object oriented, interactive and scripting language that allows
a flexible and versatile interface to computational tools. The Forthon
package generates the necessary wrapping code which allows access
to the Fortran database and to the Fortran subroutines and functions.
This provides a development package where the computationally intensive
parts of a code can be written in efficient Fortran, and the high
level controlling code can be written in the much more versatile Python
language.

<P>
The developer creates an interface file that describes what part of
the fortran is to be accessible from Python. Variables defined in
Fortran modules can be made accessible, including scalars, arrays,
and variables of derived type. A subset of the Fortran subroutines,
as specified in the interface file, can be called from Python, with
argument lists including scalars, arrays, and variables of derived
type. Arrays can be statically dimensioned or dynamically dimensioned,
in which case Fortran95 style pointers are used. Variables of derived
type can be pointers, and derived types can have elements which are
themselves derived types or pointers to derived types. A tool is included
which will automatically compile the user's source code and the generated
wrapping code into a Python module.

<P>

Forthon is licensed under the <A href="License.txt">BSD license</A>, enabling
reuse with few restrictions.

<P>

<H3>
Where to get it?
</H3>
<A href= "Forthon-0.8.32.tgz">Forthon-0.8.32.tgz</A>

<P>

Forthon is also available with git:
<P>
git clone https://github.com/dpgrote/Forthon.git
<P>

<H3>
Installation
</H3>
<P>
Forthon requires <A HREF="http://numpy.scipy.org">Numpy</A>.
<P>
Of course, a Fortran95 compiler is required. The recommended compiler is gfortran. The following are also supported:
<UL>
<LI>On Linux: Intel, Portland Group, Absoft, g95</LI>
<LI>On Mac OSX: IBM, Absoft, NAG, g95 </LI>
</UL>

<P>
To install Forthon, run "<font color=red>python setup.py install</font>".
<P>
Note that the python used to install Forthon must be the same python
that will be used with Forthon. Also, note that you will need to have
write access to the lib directory where the python modules are
installed, and to the bin directory where the python executable is installed.
<P>

<H3>
Method of Solution
</H3>

<P>
Forthon will generate the wrapping code needed to access Fortran subroutines
and data in Python, from a user created interface file that describes
the Fortran95 modules and the subroutines to be accessed from Python.
The listing of variables in the interface file includes variable type
information, array dimensions, attributes, and documentation. Additionally,
Fortran derived types can be described, and variables of derived type
defined, any of which will be accessible from Python. Built into the
wrapper are mechanisms for dealing with dynamically allocated arrays
and pointers to derived types. 

<P>
Using the interface file, Forthon generates both C and Fortran95 code
which is compiled along with the user's source code to form the Python
module. The C code contains wrapper routines which are called directly
from Python and in turn call the appropriate Fortran routines. The
wrapper processes the input arguments so that they can be passed into
the Fortran routines. For multi-dimensional arrays, transposes are
done if necessary to put the data in the correct ordering for Fortran.
(Any changes made in the data are copied back into the original so
they are seen at the Python level.) Other differences between Fortran
and C, such as subroutine name mangling and passing of character string
lengths, are handled automatically. The C code also contains a database
of the variables in the Fortran modules. For each variable, the memory
location of the data is stored. This data is updated as appropriate
for dynamic arrays and pointers to derived types. The automatically
generated Fortran code contains the definitions of the modules as
defined in the interface file (this can be skipped if the modules
are already defined), as well as other routines that carry out actions
such as passing variable memory locations to the C and doing proper
Fortran95 pointer assignments to data passed in from C.

<P>
At the Python level, for each interface file, a Python object is created
that is used to access the information from Fortran; it uses Python's
standard interface to get and set object attributes. Dynamic arrays
and derived types can be assigned to, and new instances of variables
of derived type can be created.

<P>
Tools are included for doing dynamic array allocation, allowing all
of the dynamic arrays in a Fortran module to be allocated in one call.
The sizes of dynamic arrays can then later be changed, preserving
any existing data. 

<P>
Tools are also available to write all (or a selection) of the data
out to disk in a self-describing file format, allowing data to be
retrieved for later use. Python modules, written by others, that wrap
libraries for self-describing data such as HDF, are used.

<P>
The layout of the interface file was taken originally from the Basis
package and extended.

<P>

<H3>
Forthon attempts to be very portable
</H3>

<P>
Forthon runs with Python versions 2 and 3.

<P>
Forthon runs on the major OS flavors:
Unix, MacOSX, Windows

<P>
Forthon will run on most computers, from laptops, to workstations,
to massively parallel supercomputers.


<H3>
Limitations
</H3>

<P>
Forthon does not support all features of Fortran95. Some of the major
features not supported include the use of IntentIn and IntentOut attributes
on subroutine arguments and functions which returns arrays. Also,
Forthon can only process integer and real variables of kind that match
the length of integers and reals used by Python, i.e. the same size
in bytes as longs and doubles in C. These limitations may be removed
in future versions.

<P>

<H3>
Unique Features
</H3>

<P>
Forthon makes use of interface files, which allows more information
about variables to be given than by obtaining the information from
the original Fortran. The information includes type, documentation,
units, and attributes.

<P>
Forthon can wrap variables of Fortran derived type so they are accessible
from Python.

<P>
Forthon also has database management tools to do such things as allocate
groups of dynamic arrays and change there sizes while preserving any
existing data.

<P>
<H3>
Future directions
</H3>
<P>
Implement arrays of derived type quantities.
<P>
Make the derived types picklable. (Already done!)
<P>
Parse the fortran source to gather additional information, or to replace parts
or all of variable description file.
